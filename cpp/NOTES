TODO
====
* Use STL::lower_bound in build_L/build_G, since CRS.col_ind is sorted
   - and also in matrix_crs::diag

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* Output the pixel assignments to a cv::Mat and show segments on original image
   - write intensity_to_image3, which returns a three channel (BGR) matrix
   - then add the grayscale image (in BGR) plus another BGR image for the seg

* the image size (n x n) is currently stored in params; it should instead/also be returned directly to the caller via the drivers
