TODO
====
* Use STL::lower_bound in build_L/build_G, since CRS.col_ind is sorted
   - and also in matrix_crs::diag

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* Our segments are rotated (test on peppers_50) 90 deg. CW.
