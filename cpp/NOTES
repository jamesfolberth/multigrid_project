====
* Since JMF fixed a few things, some pixels aren't begin assigned, even in the non-unique U (e.g. arrow_5)

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* valgrind -v --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full ./image_seg 
  is finding some potentially lost blocks.  I think these might be coming from OpenCV.
