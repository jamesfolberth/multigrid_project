====
* Spurious segmentation for checkerd disk?

* Our code finds some boundary segments for the large peppers images.  This could just be a parameter issue.

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* valgrind -v --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full ./image_seg 
  is finding some potentially lost blocks.  I think these might be coming from OpenCV.
