TODO
====
* Use STL::lower_bound in build_L/build_G, since CRS.col_ind is sorted
   - and also in matrix_crs::diag

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* valgrind -v --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full ./image_seg 
  is finding some potentially lost blocks.  I think these might be coming from OpenCV.
