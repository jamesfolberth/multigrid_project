====
* Spurious segmentation for checkered disk?
  - Did the authors use the max off-diagonal row element instead of off-diagonal row sum method in coarsen_AMG?

* Different segments between C++ and Julia implementations
  - We think that this is due to peppers_*.jpg being a color image.  OpenCV and whatever Julia uses may convert the image to grayscale differently.  Making peppers_* grayscale beforehand, so C++ and Julia use exactly the same images, should fix this.

* Our code finds some pepper boundary segments for the large peppers images.  This could just be a parameter issue.

* It seems that we don't need to build all of L and G; we only need the 
  diagonal elements, which correspond to the row sums (excluding the diagonal)

* valgrind -v --track-origins=yes --leak-check=full ./image_seg 
  is finding some potentially lost blocks.  I think these might be coming from OpenCV.
